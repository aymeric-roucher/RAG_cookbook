Iandola, Albert E. Shaw, Ravi Krishna, Kurt W. Keutzer. It's a\nbidirectional transformer similar to the BERT model.

In this work, we observe that methods\nsuch as grouped convolutions have yielded significant speedups for computer vision networks, but many of these\ntechniques have not been adopted by NLP neural network designers. We demonstrate how to replace several operations in\nself-attention layers with grouped convolutions, and we use this technique in a novel network architecture called\nSqueezeBERT, which runs 4.3x faster than BERT-base on the Pixel 3 while achieving competitive accuracy on the GLUE test\nset.

Models trained\n  with a causal language modeling (CLM) objective are better in that regard.\n- For best results when finetuning on sequence classification tasks, it is recommended to start with the\n  *squeezebert/squeezebert-mnli-headless* checkpoint.\n\n## Resources", "* Squeeze-and-Excitation Networks\n  * Paper: `Squeeze-and-Excitation Networks` - https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.01507\n  * Code: Added to ResNet base, this is current version going forward, old `senet.py` is being deprecated\n* ECAResNet (ECA-Net)\n  * Paper: `ECA-Net: Efficient Channel Attention for Deep CNN` - https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.03151v4\n  * Code: Added to ResNet base, ECA module contributed by @VRandme, reference https://github.com/BangguWu/ECANet", "* Squeeze-and-Excitation Networks\n  * Paper: `Squeeze-and-Excitation Networks` - https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.01507\n  * Code: Added to ResNet base, this is current version going forward, old `senet.py` is being deprecated\n* ECAResNet (ECA-Net)\n  * Paper: `ECA-Net: Efficient Channel Attention for Deep CNN` - https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.03151v4\n  * Code: Added to ResNet base, ECA module contributed by @VRandme, reference https://github.com/BangguWu/ECANet", "* CBAM - https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.06521\n    * Effective Squeeze-Excitation (ESE) - https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.06667\n    * Efficient Channel Attention (ECA) - https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.03151\n    * Gather-Excite (GE) - https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.12348\n    * Global Context (GC) - https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.11492\n    * Halo - https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.12731\n    * Involution - https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.06255\n    * Lambda Layer - https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.08602\n    * Non-Local (NL) -  https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.07971\n    * Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) - https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.01507\n    * Selective Kernel (SK) - (https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.06586", "| Format                  | Safe | Zero-copy | Lazy loading | No file size limit | Layout control | Flexibility | Bfloat16/Fp8\n| ----------------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| pickle (PyTorch)        | \u2717 | \u2717 | \u2717 | \ud83d\uddf8 | \u2717 | \ud83d\uddf8 | \ud83d\uddf8 |\n| H5 (Tensorflow)         | \ud83d\uddf8 | \u2717 | \ud83d\uddf8 | \ud83d\uddf8 | ~ | ~ | \u2717 |\n| SavedModel (Tensorflow) | \ud83d\uddf8 | \u2717 | \u2717 | \ud83d\uddf8 | \ud83d\uddf8 | \u2717 | \ud83d\uddf8 |\n| MsgPack (flax)          | \ud83d\uddf8 | \ud83d\uddf8 | \u2717 | \ud83d\uddf8 | \u2717 | \u2717 | \ud83d\uddf8 |\n| Protobuf (ONNX)         | \ud83d\uddf8 | \u2717 | \u2717 | \u2717 | \u2717 | \u2717 | \ud83d\uddf8 |\n| Cap'n'Proto             | \ud83d\uddf8 | \ud83d\uddf8 | ~ | \ud83d\uddf8 | \ud83d\uddf8 | ~ | \u2717 |\n| Arrow                   | ? | ? | ? | ? | ? | ? | \u2717 |\n| Numpy (npy,npz)         | \ud83d\uddf8 | ? | ? | \u2717 | \ud83d\uddf8 | \u2717 | \u2717 |"], "eval_score_GPT4": "5", "eval_feedback_GPT4": "The response correctly identifies that SqueezeBERT uses grouped convolutions instead of fully-connected layers for the Q, K, V, and FFN layers.

FSDP achieves this by sharding the model parameters, gradients, and optimizer states across data parallel processes and it can also offload sharded model parameters to a CPU. The memory efficiency afforded by FSDP allows you to scale training to larger batch or model sizes.\n\n<Tip warning={true}>", "[Fully Sharded Data Parallel (FSDP)](https://pytorch.org/blog/introducing-pytorch-fully-sharded-data-parallel-api/) is a data parallel method that shards a model's parameters, gradients and optimizer states across the number of available GPUs (also called workers or *rank*). Unlike [DistributedDataParallel (DDP)](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.parallel.DistributedDataParallel.html), FSDP reduces memory-usage because a model is replicated on each GPU. This improves GPU memory-efficiency and allows you to train much larger models on fewer GPUs", "Fully Sharded Data Parallelism (FSDP) is a paradigm in which the optimizer states, gradients and parameters are sharded across devices. During the forward pass, each FSDP unit performs an _all-gather operation_ to get the complete weights, computation is performed followed by discarding the shards from other devices. After the forward pass, the loss is computed followed by the backward pass. In the backward pass, each FSDP unit performs an all-gather operation to get the complete weights, with computation performed to get the local gradients", "Distributed training is the key to enable training such large ML models.

These local gradients are averaged and sharded across the devices via a _reduce-scatter operation_ so that each device can update the parameters of its shard.

The model replaces the self-attention layer in a BERT\nmodel with a fourier transform which returns only the real parts of the transform. The model is significantly faster\nthan the BERT model because it has fewer parameters and is more memory efficient. The model achieves about 92-97%\naccuracy of BERT counterparts on GLUE benchmark, and trains much faster than the BERT model. The abstract from the\npaper is the following:", "*We show that Transformer encoder architectures can be sped up, with limited accuracy costs, by replacing the\nself-attention sublayers with simple linear transformations that \"mix\" input tokens. These linear mixers, along with\nstandard nonlinearities in feed-forward layers, prove competent at modeling semantic relationships in several text\nclassification tasks. Most surprisingly, we find that replacing the self-attention sublayer in a Transformer encoder\nwith a standard, unparameterized Fourier Transform achieves 92-97% of the accuracy of BERT counterparts on the GLUE\nbenchmark, but trains 80% faster on GPUs and 70% faster on TPUs at standard 512 input lengths. At longer input lengths,", "*Pre-trained language models like BERT and its variants have recently achieved impressive performance in various\nnatural language understanding tasks. However, BERT heavily relies on the global self-attention block and thus suffers\nlarge memory footprint and computation cost. Although all its attention heads query on the whole input sequence for\ngenerating the attention map from a global perspective, we observe some heads only need to learn local dependencies,\nwhich means the existence of computation redundancy. We therefore propose a novel span-based dynamic convolution to", "replace these self-attention heads to directly model local dependencies. The novel convolution heads, together with the\nrest self-attention heads, form a new mixed attention block that is more efficient at both global and local context\nlearning. We equip BERT with this mixed attention design and build a ConvBERT model. Experiments have shown that\nConvBERT significantly outperforms BERT and its variants in various downstream tasks, with lower training cost and\nfewer model parameters.

Using a string allows the direct application of any CSS unit to the encapsulating Block element, catering to more specifc design requirements.
