# End to end RAG pipeline, demonstrated

This cookbook demonstrates how to build a Retrieval-Augmented-Generation (RAG) pipeline, step-by-step.

It features an automated evaluation process and has many knobs to let you activate or deactivate some RAG tweaks to see if the performance increases.

The specific use-case demonstrated is a QA bot that answers your questions about Hugging Face packages based on their documentation. But this can be adapted, it's very simple to swith to another base of documents!
