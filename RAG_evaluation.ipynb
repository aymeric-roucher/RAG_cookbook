    "This notebook demonstrates how you can evaluate your RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation), by building a synthetic evaluation dataset and using LLM-as-a-judge to compute the accuracy of your system.\n",
    "\n",
    "For an introduction to RAG, you can check [this other cookbook](https://github.com/huggingface/cookbook/blob/main/notebooks/RAG_zephyr_langchain.ipynb)!\n",

    "### Evaluating RAG performance\n",
    "\n",
    "Since there are so many moving parts to tune with a big impact on performance, benchmarking the RAG system is crucial.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our evaluation pipeline, we will need:\n",
    "1. An evaluation dataset with question - answer couples (QA couples)\n",
    "2. An evaluator to compute the accuracy of our system on the above evaluation dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "➡️ It turns out, we can use LLMs to help us all along the way!\n",
    "1. The evaluation dataset will be synthetically generated by an LLM 🤖, and questions will be filtered out by other LLMs 🤖\n",
    "2. An [LLM-as-a-judge](https://huggingface.co/papers/2306.05685) agent 🤖 will then perform the evaluation on this synthetic dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Let's dig into it and start building our evaluation pipeline!__ First, we install the required model dependancies."

A scheduler takes a model's output (the sample which the diffusion process is iterating on) and a timestep to return a denoised sample. The timestep is important because it dictates where in the diffusion process the step is; data is generated by iterating forward *n* timesteps and inference occurs by propagating backward through the timesteps. Based on the timestep, a scheduler may be *discrete* in which case the timestep is an `int` or *continuous* in which case the timestep is a `float`.\\n\\nDepending on the context, a scheduler defines how to iteratively add noise to an image or how to update a sample based on a model's output:\\n\\n- during *training*, a scheduler adds noise (there are different algorithms for how to add noise) to a sample to train a diffusion model\\n- during *inference*, a scheduler defines how to update a sample based on a pretrained model's output\\n\\nMany schedulers are implemented from the [k-diffusion](https://github.com/crowsonkb/k-diffusion) library by [Katherine Crowson](https://github.com/crowsonkb/), and they're also widely used in A1111.

A scheduler takes a model's output (the sample which the diffusion process is iterating on) and a timestep to return a denoised sample. The timestep is important because it dictates where in the diffusion process the step is; data is generated by iterating forward *n* timesteps and inference occurs by propagating backward through the timesteps. Based on the timestep, a scheduler may be *discrete* in which case the timestep is an `int` or *continuous* in which case the timestep is a `float`.\\n\\nDepending on the context, a scheduler defines how to iteratively add noise to an image or how to update a sample based on a model's output:\\n\\n- during *training*, a scheduler adds noise (there are different algorithms for how to add noise) to a sample to train a diffusion model\\n- during *inference*, a scheduler defines how to update a sample based on a pretrained model's output\\n\\nMany schedulers are implemented from the [k-diffusion](https://github.com/crowsonkb/k-diffusion) library by [Katherine Crowson](https://github.com/crowsonkb/), and they're also widely used in A1111. To help you map the schedulers from k-diffusion and A1111 to the schedulers in 🤗 Diffusers, take a look at the table below:\\n\\n| A1111/k-diffusion    | 🤗 Diffusers                         | Usage                                                                                                         |\\n|---------------------|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\\n| DPM++ 2M            | [`DPMSolverMultistepScheduler`]     |                                                                                                               |\\n| DPM++ 2M Karras     | [`DPMSolverMultistepScheduler`]     | init with `use_karras_sigmas=True`                                                                            |\\n| DPM++ 2M SDE        | [`DPMSolverMultistepScheduler`]     | init with `algorithm_type=\"sde-dpmsolver++\"`                                                                  |\\n| DPM++ 2M SDE Karras | [`DPMSolverMultistepScheduler`]     | init with `use_karras_sigmas=True` and `algorithm_type=\"sde-dpmsolver++\"`                                     |\\n| DPM++ 2S a          | N/A                                 | very similar to  `DPMSolverSinglestepScheduler`                         |\\n| DPM++ 2S a Karras   | N/A                                 | very similar to  `DPMSolverSinglestepScheduler(use_karras_sigmas=True, ...)` |\\n| DPM++ SDE           | [`DPMSolverSinglestepScheduler`]    |                                                                                                               |\\n| DPM++ SDE Karras    | [`DPMSolverSinglestepScheduler`]    | init with `use_karras_sigmas=True`                                                                            |\\n| DPM2                | [`KDPM2DiscreteScheduler`]          |                                                                                                               |\\n| DPM2 Karras         | [`KDPM2DiscreteScheduler`]          | init with `use_karras_sigmas=True`                                                                            |\\n| DPM2 a              | [`KDPM2AncestralDiscreteScheduler`] |                                                                                                               |\\n| DPM2 a Karras       | [`KDPM2AncestralDiscreteScheduler`] | init with `use_karras_sigmas=True`                                                                            |\\n| DPM adaptive        | N/A                                 |                                                                                                               |\\n| DPM fast            | N/A                                 |                                                                                                               |\\n| Euler               | [`EulerDiscreteScheduler`]          |                                                                                                               |\\n| Euler a             | [`EulerAncestralDiscreteScheduler`] |                                                                                                               |\\n| Heun                | [`HeunDiscreteScheduler`]           |                                                                                                               |\\n| LMS                 | [`LMSDiscreteScheduler`]            |                                                                                                               |\\n| LMS Karras          | [`LMSDiscreteScheduler`]            | init with `use_karras_sigmas=True`                                                                            |\\n| N/A                 | [`DEISMultistepScheduler`]          |                                                                                                               |\\n| N/A                 | [`UniPCMultistepScheduler`]         |                                                                                                               |\\n\\nAll schedulers are built from the base [`SchedulerMixin`] class which implements low level utilities shared by all schedulers.\\n\\n## SchedulerMixin\\n[[autodoc]] SchedulerMixin\\n\\n## SchedulerOutput\\n[[autodoc]] schedulers.scheduling_utils.SchedulerOutput\\n\\n## KarrasDiffusionSchedulers\\n\\n[`KarrasDiffusionSchedulers`] are a broad generalization of schedulers in 🤗 Diffusers.

    "💡 ___When asking the agents to output a score, we first ask them to produce its rationale.
